Dalia David – Behavioral Interview with a question that will require you to code in Python.

Damian Kowalewski and Alan Frindell: They will focus on your problem solving, analytical thinking and coding.  Here are a couple of topics they might address:
- Read4k
- Circular Buffer
- Count ones in 2D Subgrid
- Sum Hamming Distances

Pritam Damania will focus on your systems design skills.  He will choose one of the following topics to cover with you:
- Memcached
- Lock Optimization



This 45 minute interview will focus on coding, your skills, experience, interests and motivations. For coding questions, you will be asked to produce clean, efficient code in a reasonable amount of time (in the language of your choice). In terms of preparation, think of it like a CS exam. There is a wide gap between industry experience and fundamental coding exercises, so I urge you to take some time to prepare for the type of questions we will ask.

Overall, we're looking for foundational coding skills. The questions will be language agnostic and algorithmically based. We will present you with a challenge and the goal is for you to come up with an optimized algorithm by the end of the interview. Make sure to comment your code and talk through your algorithm with the interviewer. There are many different ways of solving the challenge, so it is critical that the interviewer can follow your thought process and logic flow.

Lastly, the interviewer will focus on getting to know you better. The conversation will be centered around the impact you have had in your current or previous roles, and your leadership and teamwork abilities. We want to know your motivation and interest in Facebook and technology, and answer any questions you might have about our processes and culture. Engineers usually will end their time with you by asking, "What questions do you have for me?” I always recommend that you have your questions prepared beforehand on a one page sheet of paper, in case you need to reference them. Your excitement about Facebook goes a long way.

Good luck!
