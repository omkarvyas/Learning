2. 
Let x=⎡⎣⎢⎢5527⎤⎦⎥⎥
What is 2∗x?

[1010414]

⎡⎣⎢⎢1010414⎤⎦⎥⎥
Correct 
To multiply the vector x by 2, take each element of x and multiply that element by 2.

Let u be a 3-dimensional vector, where specifically

u=⎡⎣351⎤⎦
What is uT?

4. 
Let u and v be 3-dimensional vectors, where specifically

u=⎡⎣4−4−3⎤⎦
and

v=⎡⎣424⎤⎦
What is uTv?

(Hint: uT is a

1x3 dimensional matrix, and v can also be seen as a 3x1

matrix. The answer you want can be obtained by taking

the matrix product of uT and v.) Do not add brackets to your answer.

5. 
Let A and B be 3x3 (square) matrices. Which of the following

must necessarily hold true? Check all that apply.


If A is the 3x3 identity matrix, then A∗B=B∗A
Correct 
Even though matrix multiplication is not commutative in general (A∗B≠B∗A for general matrices A,B), for the special case where A=I, we have A∗B=I∗B=B, and also B∗A=B∗I=B. So, A∗B=B∗A.

A∗B∗A=B∗A∗B
Un-selected is correct 

A∗B=B∗A
Un-selected is correct 

A+B=B+A
Correct 
We add matrices element-wise. So, this must be true.
