abstraction: Hide implementation from user and let user directly use the functionality like time module or web-browser module in python we do not know how it is implemented internally but we can use various functions of this library. 

class: Basically class is a template which we can use, e.g. Let's say you want to play trailer for a movie or show info for the movie and stuff, so for each thing you do not want to repeate these steps, write same code for each movie so you write a class. 
Example: template 

title 
storyline

def show_trailer():
	#open browser and play trailer
def show_info():
	# Print movie information


webrowser.open = it is just a function call.
class
turtle.Turtle = calls init and creates memory for it
